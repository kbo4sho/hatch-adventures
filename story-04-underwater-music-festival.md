## The Hatch Adventures
### Episode 4: The Underwater Music Festival

The electric-blue tunnel crackled like popping candy.

Max held Mia's hand. Mia held Flop. And together, they tumbled forward into sparkling blue light.

*Whoooosh!*

They landed... softly.

Too softly.

Max opened his eyes. They were floating.

"Maxy, we're flying!" Mia squealed, kicking her legs.

Not flying. *Floating.*

All around them, tiny silver fish swam past in perfect formation. Above, the surface of the ocean shimmered like a blue-green sky. Below, a city made of coral towers glowed in pinks, purples, and oranges.

"We're underwater!" Max said.

He should've been panicking. But when he breathed in, it felt... normal.

Mia giggled. "Water tickles!"

Max wiggled his fingers through the current. It was like swimming and flying at the same time.

A school of fish shaped like musical notes zoomed past, humming as they went.

Then Max heard it.

Music.

It came from the coral city below—drums, bells, something that sounded like a xylophone made of shells. But it was... off. Not quite right. Like a song with missing pieces.

"Down there!" Mia pointed.

They kicked their legs and floated down toward the glowing city.

---

They landed gently on a street made of smooth sand and seashells. Coral buildings rose around them, each one a different color. Jellyfish floated by like living lamps.

And everywhere—*everywhere*—sea creatures were preparing for something big.

An octopus hung streamers made of seaweed. A crab carried a banner that said:

**ANNUAL UNDERWATER MUSIC FESTIVAL**

A sea turtle swam past wearing a little conductor's hat.

"Excuse me," Max said politely. "Are you having a concert?"

The turtle turned. Her name tag said *SHELLY*.

"Not just a concert," Shelly said with a tired sigh. "The biggest music festival of the year. Every sea creature plays their part. But this year..." She shook her head. "Something's wrong. The rhythm's all jumbled."

Mia tilted her head. "Jumbled how?"

Shelly gestured toward the town square. "Come see."

---

In the center of the coral city, a stage made of giant clamshells stood empty. Around it, different groups of sea creatures held instruments:

- A pod of dolphins with drum-shells
- A choir of singing seahorses
- A school of fish with tiny chime-scales that rang when they swam

But when they played...

*BONK-ting-CRASH-la-la-THUMP.*

It was a mess.

The dolphins drummed too fast. The seahorses sang too slow. The fish chimed at random times.

One dolphin threw up her fins. "This is hopeless!"

A seahorse sighed. "We've practiced for weeks. But we can't get it together."

Mia tugged on Max's sleeve. "They're not listening."

Max blinked. "What?"

"They're not listening to *each other,*" Mia said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

And she was right.

Each group was so focused on their own part, they weren't paying attention to anyone else.

Max swam forward. "Can we help?"

Shelly looked hopeful. "You're Hatch Hoppers, aren't you?"

"How did you—"

"The glow," Shelly said, pointing at the faint shimmer around Max's pocket where the glowing stone from the Dinosaur Garden rested. "You've been to other worlds."

Max pulled out the stone. It pulsed softly.

Mia grinned. "We help!"

---

Max looked at the three groups.

"Okay," he said. "Let's try something. Dolphins—play your drums, but *slow.* Listen to the beat I clap."

He clapped a steady rhythm: *Clap. Clap. Clap-clap.*

The dolphins copied it. Slower. Steadier.

"Good! Now, seahorses—sing, but match the drum beat."

The seahorses hummed along. At first it was shaky, but then...

*Boom-la. Boom-la. Boom-la.*

It was working.

"Now," Max said, "fish—when you hear the drums and the singing together, add your chimes on the beat."

The fish swam in a circle and—

*Ting!*

Perfect.

*Boom-la-TING. Boom-la-TING.*

The music came together like pieces of a puzzle clicking into place.

Mia started dancing, spinning in slow underwater twirls. Flop floated along beside her.

Shelly's eyes went wide. "That's it! That's the festival song!"

The octopus dropped his streamers and started clapping. The crab joined in with his claws. Soon, the whole city was swaying to the rhythm.

The music grew louder, richer. Other creatures joined in—a whale adding a deep hum, jellyfish pulsing in time like glowing drums.

Max grinned. "You just had to listen to each other."

One of the dolphins swam over and bumped Max gently with her nose. "Thank you, Hatch Hopper."

Shelly pulled out a small shell, carved with swirling patterns. It glowed the same blue as the hatch.

"A gift," she said, placing it in Mia's hands. "Blow into it, and you'll always hear the rhythm of the ocean."

Mia held it to her ear. She could hear the *thump-thump* of waves, even underwater.

"Magic shell!" she whispered.

---

Shelly led them to the edge of the city, where a hatch glowed green-blue in the sand, surrounded by softly swaying kelp.

"This one will take you somewhere quiet," Shelly said. "After all this music, you might need a rest."

Max knelt beside the hatch. The patterns on it looked like vines and leaves.

Mia pressed her face to the glass. "Maxy, I see trees!"

Max opened the hatch.

Inside, the tunnel glowed soft green, and it smelled like fresh grass and rain.

"Where do you think this one goes?" Max asked.

Mia's eyes sparkled. "Maaaaybe... A SECRET FOREST!"

Max laughed. "Only one way to find out."

Together, holding hands, they stepped into the green glowing tunnel.

Behind them, the music of the Underwater Festival played on.

### Discussion Questions for Parents:
1. Why was the music jumbled at first?
2. What did Max and Mia teach the sea creatures?
3. Can you clap a rhythm and have someone else join in?

### Activity Ideas:
- Make rhythm patterns with claps, stomps, or pots and pans
- Draw your own underwater city
- Listen to a song and count the beats
