=== TEST 1: Scene 01 (Beginning) ===
Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. Digital watercolor on cold-pressed paper with visible grain texture throughout. Warm sepia ink outlines (#4A3728) with organic hand-drawn quality and varying line weight (2-3px on character contours, 1px on details). Golden hour lighting with warm amber glow and soft directional light from above. Warm-dominant analogous color scheme: peach-orange sky (#E8956A), golden amber (#E8B060), olive greens (#8B9A4B), coral pinks (#E06070). Cool accents: cobalt blue (#3A5FA0), cyan-teal glow (#7EC8D4). Medium-high saturation tempered by watercolor translucency. Visible watercolor paper grain, layered transparent washes with soft bleeding at edges, pigment granulation in darker areas. Two children tumbling onto a springy, color-changing floor in a bright futuristic playground. A 7-year-old boy named Max with brown hair (warm highlights, soft mass with strand suggestions), wearing a cobalt blue t-shirt (#3A5FA0) and khaki shorts, pushes himself up with eyes wide with wonder. He has rosy pink cheek spots, large round dot eyes (black with white highlight), and a small open crescent mouth. His 3-year-old sister Mia with blonde hair in pigtails (pink bows), wearing a coral-pink dress (#E06070) and red shoes, bounces once and giggles. She has rosy cheek spots and holds a small white stuffed bunny named Flop (simple silhouette, floppy ears). Both characters are 3-4 heads tall with chibi-adjacent proportions. The futuristic playground has smooth paths and soft tiles that glow in warm pastel blues and pinks under their feet, rendered with watercolor texture. Above them, a warm amber sky (#E8B060) with floating clouds shaped like gears. In the background (soft, desaturated), friendly robots of simple geometric shapes play together. Three-plane depth: detailed foreground tiles, character midground, soft background fading to warm orange. Atmospheric perspective. Safe and magical atmosphere. NO pure black, NO digitally smooth areas, NO harsh lighting.

=== TEST 2: Scene 04 (Middle - Intimate Moment) ===
Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. Digital watercolor on cold-pressed paper with visible grain texture throughout. Warm sepia ink outlines (#4A3728) with organic hand-drawn quality and varying line weight (2-3px on character contours, 1px on details). Golden hour lighting with warm amber glow and soft directional light from above. Warm-dominant analogous color scheme: peach-orange ambient light (#E8956A), golden amber highlights (#E8B060), olive greens (#8B9A4B), coral pinks (#E06070). Cool accents: cobalt blue (#3A5FA0), soft pastel blues and pinks in tiles. Medium-high saturation tempered by watercolor translucency. Visible watercolor paper grain, layered transparent washes with soft bleeding at edges, pigment granulation in darker areas. A 7-year-old boy named Max with brown hair (warm highlights, soft mass with strand suggestions), wearing a cobalt blue t-shirt (#3A5FA0) and khaki shorts, crouching down to be at eye level with a small sad robot. Max has rosy pink cheek spots, large round dot eyes (black with white highlight), and a gentle small smile (crescent mouth). Behind him, his 3-year-old sister Mia with blonde pigtails (pink bows), wearing a coral-pink dress (#E06070), holds up a small white stuffed bunny named Flop to introduce it. She has rosy cheek spots. Both children are 3-4 heads tall with chibi-adjacent proportions and simplified mitten-like hands. The robot (PLAY-7) is small and boxy (about waist-high to Max), rendered with watercolor texture showing simple geometric body, a screen-face with a flickering tiny blue dot, holding a glowing hover-ball (cyan-teal glow #7EC8D4 with soft radial light). The playground's colorful tiles glow softly in warm pastel blues and pinks around them, all with visible paper texture. In the background (soft, desaturated toward warm orange), other simple geometric robots watch from a distance. Three-plane depth: foreground tiles, character midground with full saturation, soft background. Warm brown shadows (not black). Quiet, kind, intimate moment. Safe and hopeful atmosphere.

=== TEST 3: Scene 07 (Action/Joy - Near End) ===
Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. Digital watercolor on cold-pressed paper with visible grain texture throughout. Warm sepia ink outlines (#4A3728) with organic hand-drawn quality and varying line weight (2-3px on character contours, 1px on details). Golden hour lighting with warm amber glow and soft directional light from above. Warm-dominant analogous color scheme: peach-orange sky (#E8956A), golden amber highlights (#E8B060), coral pinks (#E06070), warm pastel blues and pinks. Cool accents: cobalt blue (#3A5FA0), cyan-teal glow effects (#7EC8D4). Medium-high saturation tempered by watercolor translucency. Visible watercolor paper grain, layered transparent washes with soft bleeding at edges, pigment granulation in darker areas, dry brush detailing for texture. A small robot (PLAY-7, boxy geometric body waist-high to children, rendered with watercolor texture) sitting on a swing with its screen-face showing a big smile, swinging forward joyfully. A cheerful lunchbox-shaped robot (GREET-0) pushes the swing gently from behind, its antenna wiggling. A 7-year-old boy named Max with brown hair (warm highlights, soft mass), wearing a cobalt blue t-shirt (#3A5FA0) and khaki shorts, stands nearby cheering with raised arms. He has rosy pink cheek spots, large round dot eyes with highlights, open crescent mouth showing joy. A 3-year-old girl Mia with blonde pigtails (pink bows), wearing a coral-pink dress (#E06070), sits on the bouncy floor kicking her feet happily, a small white stuffed bunny (Flop) beside her. She has rosy cheek spots. Both children are 3-4 heads tall with chibi-adjacent proportions and simplified mitten-like hands. The playground lights flash like a celebration in soft warm pastels (blues and pinks with watercolor texture, not neon-harsh). Other friendly robots (simple geometric shapes, desaturated) cheer in the background. PLAY-7 has a small star sticker on its chest. Warm amber sky (#E8B060) above. Three-plane depth: detailed foreground swing/ground, character midground with full saturation, soft background fading to warm orange. Warm brown shadows. Pure joy, inclusion, friendship. Bright vibrant colors tempered by watercolor medium, warm golden lighting, festive atmosphere. NO pure black, NO digitally smooth areas, NO harsh lighting.
