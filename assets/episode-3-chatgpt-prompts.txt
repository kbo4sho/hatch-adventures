His 3-year-old sister with blonde pigtails in a pink dress (Mia) bounces excitedly on the color-changing floor.

A cheerful lunchbox-shaped robot (GREET-0) with bright green eyes on a screen-face and a wiggly antenna greets them. Behind them, a morning sky with floating cloud-shaped gears. Other robots play in the background. Warm golden lighting with vibrant neon accents. Safe, magical, wonder-filled atmosphere. Bold, memorable composition suitable for an opening sequence.
