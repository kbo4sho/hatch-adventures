## 01.png — The Neon Playground

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. Two children bouncing onto a springy, color-changing floor in a bright futuristic playground. The playground has smooth silver paths, glowing neon rails, and soft rubbery tiles that light up under their feet — blue under the boy, pink under the girl. Above, a morning sky with floating clouds shaped like gears. In the background, small friendly robots of different shapes and sizes play together — one pushes another on a swing, one builds a block tower, a tiny one chases a glowing hover-ball. Vibrant neon colors, futuristic but friendly.

## 02.png — Meeting GREET-0

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. A cheerful robot the size of a 7-year-old, shaped like a friendly lunchbox with bright green eyes on a screen-face and a little antenna that wiggles. It rolls up to two children on the colorful playground floor. The boy (brown hair, blue shirt) smiles at it. The little girl (blonde pigtails, pink dress) holds up her stuffed white bunny to introduce it. Behind them, a glowing sign reads "ROBOT PLAYGROUND" with smaller text "RULE #1: EVERYONE GETS A TURN." Friendly, welcoming, bright neon playground.

## 03.png — PLAY-7 Sitting Alone

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. Behind a shiny climbing dome on a futuristic playground, a small robot sits alone holding a little hover-ball. Its screen-face shows a tiny blue dot like a sad raindrop. It stares at the ground while other robots play happily in the background. Two children and a lunchbox-shaped robot watch from nearby with concerned expressions. The lonely robot is smaller than the others, slightly dusty. Contrast between the bright, active playground and this quiet, lonely corner. Empathetic, gentle mood.

The playground's colorful tiles glow softly around them. Other robots watch curiously from a distance. Quiet, kind, intimate moment. Warm lighting.

The ball floats slightly above the ground, leaving a trail of soft light. The robot stares at the ball with curiosity. Nearby, a boy watches with an encouraging smile. The lunchbox-shaped robot (GREET-0) watches with its antenna perked up. Simple, sweet moment of connection. The colorful floor tiles glow around them. Gentle, hopeful atmosphere.

## 06.png — PLAY-7 Laughs

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. A small robot (PLAY-7) with its screen-face showing a small curved smile. It has just made its first laugh — a tiny robot hiccup. A little girl bursts out laughing beside it. A boy grins proudly. The lunchbox-shaped robot (GREET-0) spins in a happy circle nearby. Confetti-like lights flash on the colorful playground floor. Other robots are starting to notice and roll closer. A tall robot holds out a jump-rope made of glowing light. A tiny robot bounces up holding star stickers. Celebration, joy, breakthrough moment.

GREET-0 (lunchbox-shaped robot) pushes the swing gently from behind. A boy stands nearby cheering. A little girl sits on the bouncy floor kicking her feet happily, her stuffed bunny beside her. The playground lights flash like a celebration. Other robots cheer in the background. PLAY-7 has a star sticker on its chest. Pure joy, inclusion, friendship. Bright neon colors, festive atmosphere.

## 08.png — The Electric-Blue Hatch

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. Under a shiny slide behind a climbing dome on a futuristic playground, a round metal hatch with swirly patterns glows electric blue. Two children kneel beside it — the boy reaches for the handle, the girl grabs his hand. PLAY-7 rolls over holding out a hover-ball as a gift. GREET-0 salutes nearby. Other robots wave goodbye in the background. The playground's neon lights create a warm glow. Bittersweet farewell but excited for the next adventure. The hatch crackles softly with blue light.
