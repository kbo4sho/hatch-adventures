## 01.png — Floating Underwater

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. Two children floating underwater in a magical ocean. A 7-year-old boy (brown hair, blue shirt) and his 3-year-old sister (blonde pigtails, pink dress) look amazed as they realize they can breathe underwater. They're surrounded by tiny silver fish swimming in formation. Above them, the ocean surface shimmers with blue-green light. Below, a glowing coral city made of pink, purple, and orange towers.

## 02.png — The Coral City

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. A vibrant underwater city made of colorful coral towers in pinks, purples, and oranges. Two children land gently on a street made of smooth sand and seashells. Jellyfish float by like glowing lamps. An octopus hangs seaweed streamers. A crab carries a banner reading "ANNUAL UNDERWATER MUSIC FESTIVAL." A friendly sea turtle wearing a small conductor's hat swims nearby. Fish swim between coral buildings. Everything glows softly. Festive, magical underwater city preparing for a celebration.

## 03.png — Meet Shelly the Conductor

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. A wise old sea turtle (Shelly) wearing a conductor's hat floats in front of two children in an underwater coral city. She has a kind expression but looks tired and worried. The boy listens carefully. The little girl tilts her head curiously. Behind them, coral buildings glow warmly. Small fish swim past. Shelly has a name tag that says "SHELLY." Gentle, conversational moment underwater. Soft lighting, friendly atmosphere.

## 04.png — The Jumbled Rehearsal

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. A large stage made of giant open clamshells in an underwater town square. Three groups of sea creatures rehearsing but playing out of sync: dolphins with drum-shells playing too fast, seahorses singing slowly, and colorful fish with tiny chime-scales swimming randomly. Musical notes float chaotically in the water. One dolphin throws up her fins in frustration. A seahorse looks discouraged. Two children watch from the side. Instruments floating around. Chaotic but not scary — just messy and out of rhythm.

## 05.png — Max Teaching Rhythm

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. A boy (brown hair, blue shirt) clapping his hands underwater, creating visible ripples. He's teaching rhythm to a group of friendly dolphins holding drum-shells. The dolphins watch him carefully and copy the beat. His little sister sits nearby watching with her stuffed bunny. Musical notes appear in the water in a steady pattern. Seahorses and fish watch from the background. Teaching moment, focused and encouraging. Warm underwater lighting, everyone paying attention.

## 06.png — The Music Comes Together

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. All three groups playing together in harmony: dolphins drumming in rhythm, seahorses singing beautifully, and fish chiming at the perfect moments. Musical notes float in organized patterns through the water forming a visual melody. The little girl (blonde pigtails, pink dress) spins and dances underwater, her dress and hair flowing gracefully. Her stuffed bunny floats beside her. An octopus and crab clap along in the background. Shelly the sea turtle conductor smiles with joy. Perfect harmony, celebration, magical underwater concert.

## 07.png — The Festival Begins

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. The entire underwater coral city celebrating together. The clamshell stage glows with bioluminescent lights. Dolphins, seahorses, fish, a massive whale, glowing jellyfish, and many other sea creatures all making music together. Colorful musical notes and sound waves ripple through the water. Streamers and decorations everywhere. Two children smile and watch from the front, surrounded by the festival's glow. The whole city sways to the rhythm. Joyful, vibrant, full of life. Grand celebration atmosphere.

## 08.png — The Green Glowing Hatch

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. At the edge of the underwater city, a glowing green-blue hatch embedded in the sandy ocean floor, surrounded by softly swaying kelp and sea grass. Shelly the conductor sea turtle gives a small carved shell to the little girl. The boy kneels by the hatch peering through it — inside you can see a green glowing tunnel with the hint of trees and forest. The whale and other sea creatures wave goodbye in the background. Festival music continues around them. Bittersweet farewell, anticipation for the next adventure. Peaceful, magical.
