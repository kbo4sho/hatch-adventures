# The Hatch Adventures - Style DNA

**Visual Identity Guide for Episode Consistency**

## Core Style Summary

Digital illustration emulating traditional watercolor on cold-pressed paper. Warm-dominant analogous color scheme with strategic cool accents. Hand-drawn ink outlines in warm sepia tones. Chibi-adjacent character proportions (3-head-tall). Golden hour lighting throughout. Atmospheric depth with three distinct planes. Moderate-to-high saturation tempered by watercolor translucency.

## Technical Specifications

### Medium & Texture
- **Digital watercolor simulation** with omnipresent paper grain texture
- **Cold-pressed watercolor paper effect** — visible tooth/grain throughout every surface
- **Layered transparent washes** that bleed softly at edges (wet-on-wet technique)
- **Pigment granulation** visible in darker areas, especially blues and browns
- **Dry brush detailing** for texture on rocks, hair, fabric folds
- **No digitally smooth areas** — even highlights retain paper texture

### Line Work
- **Variable weight:** 1-3px equivalents
  - Thicker (2-3px) on character contour lines
  - Thinner (1px) on interior detail work
  - Loose sketchy lines on environmental textures
  - Minimal/absent on distant backgrounds for atmospheric depth
- **Color:** Warm sepia/dark brown (#4A3728) NOT pure black
- **Style:** Organic hand-drawn quality with slight wobble — not vector-perfect
- **Hierarchy:** Closed shapes for characters, open gestural strokes for environment

### Color Palette (Specific Tones)

**Warm dominants:**
- Sky/ambient: Peach-orange (#E8956A), golden amber (#E8B060), Naples yellow (#F2D98A)
- Browns: Raw sienna (#C68642), burnt umber (#6E4B2A), dark bark (#3D2B1A)
- Greens: Warm olive (#8B9A4B), sap green (#6B8E3A), yellow-green (#A4B84D)
- Character accents: Coral pink (#E06070), salmon flowers, rosy cheeks

**Cool accents (strategic):**
- Boy's clothing: Cobalt blue (#3A5FA0)
- Special effects: Cyan-teal glow (#7EC8D4) for magic elements
- Foliage shadows: Muted blue-greens

**Saturation level:** Medium-to-high but never garish — tempered by watercolor translucency and visible texture

### Character Design Rules

**Proportions:**
- 3-4 heads tall (oversized heads, small bodies)
- Chibi-adjacent endearing look
- Large round heads, simplified anatomy

**Max (7-year-old boy):**
- Brown hair with warm highlights, soft mass with strand suggestions
- Cobalt blue t-shirt (#3A5FA0), khaki shorts, blue shoes
- Rosy pink cheek spots
- Large round dot eyes (black with white highlight)
- Small crescent mouth for expressions
- Simplified mitten-like hands with gesture emphasis

**Mia (3-year-old girl):**
- Blonde hair in pigtails with pink bows
- Coral-pink dress (#E06070), red shoes
- Rosy pink cheek spots
- Slightly smaller than Max, more toddler proportions
- Same dot eyes and crescent mouth style
- Carries Flop (white stuffed bunny)

**Flop (stuffed bunny):**
- Small white bunny with floppy ears
- Simple silhouette, minimal detail
- Often held by Mia or Max

**Expression system:**
- Dot eyes with prominent white highlights = wonder/curiosity
- Open crescent mouths = joy/excitement
- Simple geometric shapes convey maximum emotion
- Body posture reinforces facial expression

**Consistent costume coding across ALL scenes — no outfit changes mid-episode**

### Lighting & Atmosphere

**Golden hour standard:**
- Warm orange-amber ambient light from sky
- Soft directional lighting (usually from above/behind)
- Gentle shadows in warm brown tones (not black)
- Highlights in Naples yellow (#F2D98A)
- Atmospheric glow permeates entire scene

**Depth treatment (3 planes):**
1. **Foreground:** High saturation, sharp edges, detailed texture
2. **Midground:** Full saturation, moderate detail, character focus
3. **Background:** Desaturated toward warm orange, soft edges, minimal detail

**Special effects (glow, magic):**
- Cyan-teal (#7EC8D4) for magical elements
- Soft radial glow with no hard edges
- Subtle rainbow light in mist/water
- Maintains watercolor texture even in glowing areas

### Composition Patterns

- Characters positioned in lower 2/3 of frame
- Rule of thirds for key focal points
- Environmental framing (foreground flora, rocks, architectural elements)
- Negative space in sky area (top 1/3)
- Diagonal compositional flow for dynamic scenes
- Static center-frame for quiet/intimate moments

## Style Application Rules

**For EVERY new image:**

1. **Start with base style description:**
   "Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. Digital watercolor on cold-pressed paper with visible grain texture throughout. Warm sepia ink outlines with organic hand-drawn quality and varying line weight."

2. **Establish lighting:**
   "Golden hour lighting with warm amber glow. Soft directional light from above. Gentle shadows in warm brown tones."

3. **Define color palette:**
   "Warm-dominant analogous color scheme: peach-orange sky (#E8956A), golden amber (#E8B060), olive greens (#8B9A4B), coral pinks (#E06070). Cool accents: cobalt blue (#3A5FA0), cyan-teal glow (#7EC8D4). Medium-high saturation tempered by watercolor translucency."

4. **Describe characters consistently:**
   Always include: age, hair color/style, clothing colors (use hex codes), proportions, rosy cheek spots, dot eyes with highlights, crescent mouths

5. **Add texture details:**
   "Visible watercolor paper grain, layered transparent washes with soft bleeding at edges, pigment granulation in darker areas, dry brush detailing for texture."

6. **Set depth/atmosphere:**
   "Three-plane depth: detailed foreground, character midground, soft desaturated background fading to warm orange. Atmospheric perspective."

7. **Never mention:**
   - "Digital" or "computer-generated" (breaks the analog illusion)
   - "Photorealistic" or "3D"
   - Modern art styles (keep it classic picture book)

## Quality Checklist

Before approving any generated image, verify:

- [ ] Paper grain texture visible throughout (even in highlights)
- [ ] Line work is warm sepia, not pure black
- [ ] Characters maintain 3-4 head proportions
- [ ] Max in blue t-shirt, Mia in pink dress (consistent costumes)
- [ ] Rosy cheek spots present on all characters
- [ ] Sky has warm orange-amber tones
- [ ] Colors are saturated but not garish
- [ ] Background shows atmospheric fading
- [ ] Watercolor bleeding visible at color boundaries
- [ ] No digitally smooth/gradient areas
- [ ] Composition follows 3-plane depth structure

## Common Failure Modes (Avoid)

❌ **Too digital/smooth** — No paper texture, gradient fills, vector-clean edges
❌ **Wrong color temperature** — Cool-toned sky, gray shadows, desaturated overall
❌ **Inconsistent character design** — Different proportions, outfit changes, wrong hair/clothing
❌ **Black outlines** — Pure black lines instead of warm sepia
❌ **Over-detailed** — Too anatomically correct, realistic rendering, individual scales/feathers
❌ **Flat composition** — No depth planes, everything same focus level
❌ **Harsh lighting** — Hard shadows, spot lighting, dramatic contrast

## Episode-Specific Adaptations

While maintaining core style DNA, each episode can have:
- **Setting-specific color palette shifts** (but keep warm-dominant overall)
- **Thematic elements** (robots, underwater, etc.) rendered in the same watercolor style
- **Environmental textures** unique to setting (metal, water, candy) — but with watercolor treatment

**NON-NEGOTIABLE consistency across ALL episodes:**
- Character designs (Max, Mia, Flop)
- Watercolor paper texture technique
- Warm sepia line work
- Golden hour lighting base
- 3-plane depth structure
- Expression system (dot eyes, crescent mouths)
- Chibi-adjacent proportions
