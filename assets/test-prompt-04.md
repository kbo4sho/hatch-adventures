## 04.png — Saying Hi to PLAY-7 (CONSISTENCY TEST)

Children's book illustration style, warm and inviting. A 7-year-old boy named Max with brown hair wearing a blue t-shirt and khaki shorts crouches down to be at eye level with a small sad robot sitting on a colorful futuristic playground floor. Max smiles gently with a kind, encouraging expression. Behind him stands his 3-year-old sister Mia with blonde hair in pigtails, wearing a pink dress, holding up a small white stuffed bunny named Flop to introduce it. The robot (PLAY-7) is smaller than the children, with a boxy body, a rectangular screen-face showing a tiny blue dot (like a sad raindrop), and it holds a small glowing hover-ball that floats slightly above its hands. The playground floor is made of soft rubbery tiles that glow in pastel blues and pinks under their feet. In the background, other friendly robots (various geometric shapes - round, rectangular, cylindrical) watch curiously from a distance near smooth silver playground structures. Soft neon glow from the playground rails creates ambient lighting. Clean modern illustration with smooth shapes, vibrant neon accent colors (electric blue, hot pink, mint green), friendly geometric character designs. Quiet, kind, intimate moment. Warm inviting atmosphere despite the futuristic setting. Consistent character proportions - Max is child-sized, Mia is toddler-height, PLAY-7 is about waist-high to Max.
