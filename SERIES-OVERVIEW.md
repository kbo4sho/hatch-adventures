# 🚪 The Hatch Adventures
### A Story Series for Kids

## Concept
Two siblings—**Max** (7) and **Mia** (3)—discover magical hatches that transport them to incredible places across time, space, and imagination. Each adventure starts when they exit a hatch and ends when they enter a new one, setting up the next story.

## Main Characters

### Mia (3 years old, girl)
- Blonde hair (loose, not pigtails)
- Imaginative, fearless, giggly
- Loves animals, colors, and singing
- Calls Max "Maxy"
- Wears: pink dress
- Carries: stuffed bunny named "Flop"
