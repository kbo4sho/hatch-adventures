## Episode 3: The Robot Playground

The mint-green tunnel sounded like soft wind chimes.

Max held Mia’s hand. Mia held Flop. Flop held… nothing, because Flop was a bunny, not a helper.

Whooooosh!

They tumbled out of the hatch and landed on something springy.

Boing.

Mia bounced once and giggled. "Maxy! It’s bouncy floor!"

Max pushed himself up and stared.

They were standing in the brightest playground he’d ever seen.

Not a regular playground with wood chips and slides.

This playground was made of smooth silver paths, glowing neon rails, and soft rubbery tiles that changed color under their feet.

When Max stepped, the tile lit up blue.

When Mia stepped, hers lit up pink.

Mia wiggled her toes. "It’s like… dance lights!"

Above them, the sky looked like morning—but with floating clouds shaped like gears.

And everywhere… robots.

Small robots. Tall robots. Round robots. Robots with wheels. Robots with legs.

Most of them were laughing and playing.

One robot was gently pushing another on a swing.

One robot was building a block tower with perfect right angles.

A tiny robot was chasing a glowing ball that hovered an inch above the ground.

Max said, "Okay. This is awesome."

A cheerful voice rang out.

"WELCOME, NEW PLAYERS!"

A robot rolled up to them. It was about Max’s height and shaped like a friendly lunchbox, with bright green eyes on a screen-face and a little antenna that wiggled when it talked.

"I am GREET-0," it said proudly. "I greet. That is my job."

Mia waved. "Hi, Greet-oh!"

"HELLO, SMALL HUMAN," GREET-0 said. Then it leaned closer. "IS THAT A BUNNY?"

Mia lifted Flop. "Flop."

"HELLO, FLOP," GREET-0 said politely.

Max smiled. "We’re Max and Mia. Where are we?"

GREET-0 pointed at a sign made of glowing letters.

Robot Playground.

Under it, in smaller letters:

Rule number one: everyone gets a turn.

Mia nodded seriously. "Good rule."

"Yes," GREET-0 agreed. "TURN-TAKING IS PEACEFUL."

Max noticed something else.

Off to the side, behind a shiny climbing dome, sat a robot all alone.

It wasn’t playing.

It was holding a little hover-ball and staring at the ground.

Its screen-face showed a tiny blue dot, like a sad raindrop.

Max lowered his voice. "Who’s that?"

GREET-0’s antenna drooped. "THAT IS PLAY-7. PLAY-7 DOES NOT PLAY."

Mia frowned. "Why not?"

GREET-0 clicked softly. "PLAY-7’S LAUGH MODULE IS OFFLINE."

Max blinked. "Like… it can’t laugh?"

"CORRECT," said GREET-0. "NO LAUGH. NO PLAY."

Mia looked at Max with big eyes.

That look said: we help.

Max nodded. "Let’s go say hi."

They walked over slowly.

Max crouched down. "Hi. I’m Max. This is Mia."

Mia held up Flop. "And Flop."

PLAY-7 looked up. Its screen-face flickered.

"HELLO," it said quietly. "I AM PLAY-7."

Max pointed to the hover-ball. "That’s cool. Do you want to play?"

PLAY-7 looked at the playground.

Then back at the ball.

"I DO NOT KNOW HOW," PLAY-7 said.

Mia stepped closer and tapped the ball.

The ball floated up.

Mia whispered, "Ooooo."

Then Mia did something she was very good at.

She made it simple.

Mia took one step back, then rolled the hover-ball gently toward PLAY-7.

"Your turn," she said.

PLAY-7 stared.

Then it pushed the ball back.

It wobbled, then floated.

Max caught it.

"Nice!" Max said. "Okay—my turn."

He rolled it to Mia.

Mia squealed and rolled it back.

Soon, the three of them were playing a slow, bouncy game of pass-the-hover-ball.

GREET-0 watched.

Its antenna perked up.

"OBSERVATION," GREET-0 announced. "PLAY-7 IS PLAYING."

PLAY-7’s screen-face changed.

The sad blue dot became… a small curve.

Almost a smile.

Then PLAY-7 made a sound.

It wasn’t a perfect laugh.

It was more like a tiny robot hiccup.

"HA."

Mia burst out laughing for real.

"He laughed!"

PLAY-7 blinked. "I… LAUGHED?"

Max grinned. "You did!"

GREET-0 spun in a happy circle. "LAUGH MODULE IS REBOOTING VIA FRIENDSHIP."

Mia clapped. "Friendship fix!"

Other robots noticed.

A tall robot rolled over and held out a jump-rope made of glowing light.

"INVITE," it said.

A tiny robot bounced up holding two stickers shaped like stars.

"REWARD," it chirped.

Max took a star sticker and stuck it on PLAY-7’s chest.

Mia stuck hers on Flop.

"Now Flop is robot," Mia declared.

PLAY-7’s screen-face showed a bigger smile.

"I WOULD LIKE TO TRY THE SWING," PLAY-7 said.

"Let’s do it," Max said.

They walked to the swing set.

Max helped PLAY-7 sit.

GREET-0 pushed gently.

PLAY-7 swung forward.

Then backward.

Then forward again.

And this time, the laugh came out louder.

"HA-HA!"

The whole playground cheered.

Lights on the ground flashed like a celebration.

Mia pointed behind the climbing dome. "Maxy… hatch."

Behind the dome, hidden under a shiny slide, was a round metal hatch with swirly patterns.

This one glowed electric blue.

PLAY-7 rolled over and held out the hover-ball.

"GIFT," it said. "FOR HATCH HOPPERS."

Max accepted it carefully. "Thanks, PLAY-7."

Mia waved. "Bye robots!"

GREET-0 saluted. "REMEMBER RULE #1: EVERYONE GETS A TURN."

Max nodded. "We will."

He knelt at the hatch.

Mia grabbed his hand.

"Hands together," she said.

"Deep breath," Max replied.

"Hatch time," they said together.

Max opened the hatch.

Inside, the tunnel glowed electric blue and crackled softly like popping candy.

"Where do you think this one goes?" Max asked.

Mia smiled. "Maaaaybe… UNDERWATER MUSIC!"

Max laughed. "Only one way to find out."

And together, the Hatch Hoppers stepped into the electric-blue light.
