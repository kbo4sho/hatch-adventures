# Hatch Hoppers — Episode 2 Narration Script

## [INTRO]

Welcome, Hatch Hoppers. I'm your story guide. Max is seven, Mia is three, and today… we're stepping into the unknown. Hands together. Deep breath. Hatch time.

## [SCENE 01] — Landing on the Cloud

The pink tunnel sparkled as Max and Mia tumbled through it. Whoooosh! They landed on something soft and squishy.

"What is this?" Max asked, looking down at his feet.

"It's fluffy!" Mia bounced up and down, delighted. With each jump, the cloud puffed like whipped cream.

Around them, cotton-candy clouds floated in pink, blue, and buttery yellow. The sky sparkled like someone had sprinkled glitter everywhere.

"Look up!" Mia pointed.

In the distance, a castle made of sparkling sugar crystals reached toward the stars. But something was wrong.

## [SCENE 02] — The Dripping Castle

Chocolate. Lots and lots of chocolate.

It poured from the highest tower of the castle like a waterfall, dripping down the crystal walls and pooling on the cloud roads. Everything was getting gooey and sticky.

"The castle is melting!" Max said.

"We need to help," said a tiny voice.

Max and Mia spun around. Floating in front of them was a small, round, fluffy creature with candy-striped wings. It looked like a puffball mixed with a bird.

## [SCENE 03] — Meeting Sprinkle

"I'm Sprinkle," the creature said, looking worried. "The chocolate machine broke. I tried to fix it, but nothing works."

"What's a chocolate machine?" Mia asked.

"It makes the castle rain candy," Sprinkle explained. "But the lever got stuck. Now it won't stop!"

In the background, a lollipop-shaped guard slid past on his back on the gooey cloud road, looking confused.

"Can you help?" Sprinkle asked hopefully.

Max and Mia looked at each other. "We'll try," Max said.

## [SCENE 04] — Inside the Castle

The castle hallway was made of hard sugar glass. Their feet clicked as they walked, and every step was a little bit slippery.

The walls looked like vanilla cream with candy decorations. Giant peppermint stick columns lined both sides, shiny and striped red and white.

"Be careful," Max warned, holding Mia's hand tight.

They walked deeper into the castle, following the sound of the chocolate waterfall. The hallway glowed warmly ahead.

## [SCENE 05] — The Chocolate Rain Machine

There it was—the biggest, most complicated machine they'd ever seen.

Copper pipes twisted and turned everywhere. Candy-shaped buttons covered the front in every color of the rainbow. And there was one big lever labeled "DESSERT RAIN," jammed all the way up.

Chocolate bubbled through clear candy tubes like fizzy soda. Steam puffed out everywhere.

"How do we stop it?" Mia asked.

"I don't know," Max admitted. "But there has to be a way."

That's when they heard crying.

## [SCENE 06] — Princess Poppy

Behind the machine, they found a small princess sitting on the floor, wiping her eyes with a frosting-covered sleeve.

She wore a sparkly dress and a crown shaped like a gumdrop.

"I didn't mean to break it," she said sadly. "I was trying to make the castle smell like candy, but I pressed the wrong button."

Max kneeled beside her gently. Mia walked over and held out her stuffed white bunny.

"Here," Mia said. "Flop helps when I'm sad."

The princess looked at the bunny and smiled just a little bit.

## [SCENE 07] — Mia's Sticker Fix

Mia looked at the machine. One of the candy-shaped buttons was stuck under something. It was labeled "MEGA DRIP."

She had an idea.

From her pocket, Mia pulled out a shiny star sticker. She peeled it carefully and pressed it right under the stuck button.

"What are you doing?" Max asked.

Mia pressed harder. The sticker made the button sticky enough to pull free.

Click.

The button popped up.

"You did it!" the princess exclaimed. "You're so clever!"

## [SCENE 08] — The Mint-Green Hatch

The chocolate stopped flowing. The machine hummed peacefully. Princess Poppy was happy again.

At the edge of the castle balcony, there was a glowing hatch with swirly patterns. This one glowed mint-green.

Sprinkle did a loop-de-loop in the air. "Thank you for helping!"

The princess waved goodbye from the castle. Mia wore a heart-shaped marshmallow necklace—a gift from the castle kitchen. Max held a tiny jar of sparkling sugar dust.

They looked at each other. Ready for the next adventure?

Together, holding hands, they stepped into the glowing mint-green tunnel.
