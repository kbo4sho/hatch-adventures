# Hatch Hoppers — Episode 4 Narration Script

## [INTRO]

Welcome, Hatch Hoppers. I'm your story guide. Max is seven, Mia is three, and today… we're stepping into the unknown. Hands together. Deep breath. Hatch time.

## [SCENE 01] — Floating Underwater

The electric-blue tunnel crackled like popping candy.

Max held Mia's hand. Mia held Flop. And together, they tumbled forward into sparkling blue light.

Whoooosh!

They landed... softly. Too softly.

Max opened his eyes. They were floating.

"Maxy, we're flying!" Mia squealed, kicking her legs.

Not flying. Floating.

All around them, tiny silver fish swam past in perfect formation. Above, the surface of the ocean shimmered like a blue-green sky. Below, a city made of coral towers glowed in pinks, purples, and oranges.

"We're underwater!" Max said.

He should've been panicking. But when he breathed in, it felt... normal.

Mia giggled. "Water tickles!"

## [SCENE 02] — The Coral City

They kicked their legs and floated down toward the glowing city.

They landed gently on a street made of smooth sand and seashells. Coral buildings rose around them, each one a different color. Jellyfish floated by like living lamps.

And everywhere—everywhere—sea creatures were preparing for something big.

An octopus hung streamers made of seaweed. A crab carried a banner that said: "Annual Underwater Music Festival."

A sea turtle swam past wearing a little conductor's hat.

## [SCENE 03] — Meeting Shelly

"Excuse me," Max said politely. "Are you having a concert?"

The turtle turned. Her name tag said Shelly.

"Not just a concert," Shelly said with a tired sigh. "The biggest music festival of the year. Every sea creature plays their part. But this year..." She shook her head. "Something's wrong. The rhythm's all jumbled."

Mia tilted her head. "Jumbled how?"

Shelly gestured toward the town square. "Come see."

## [SCENE 04] — The Jumbled Rehearsal

In the center of the coral city, a stage made of giant clamshells stood empty. Around it, different groups of sea creatures held instruments:

A pod of dolphins with drum-shells. A choir of singing seahorses. A school of fish with tiny chime-scales that rang when they swam.

But when they played...

Bonk-ting-CRASH-la-la-THUMP!

It was a mess.

The dolphins drummed too fast. The seahorses sang too slow. The fish chimed at random times.

One dolphin threw up her fins. "This is hopeless!"

Mia tugged on Max's sleeve. "They're not listening."

Max blinked. "What?"

"They're not listening to each other," Mia said, like it was the most obvious thing in the world.

And she was right.

## [SCENE 05] — Teaching Rhythm

Max swam forward. "Can we help?"

Shelly looked hopeful. "You're Hatch Hoppers, aren't you?"

Max looked at the three groups.

"Okay," he said. "Let's try something. Dolphins—play your drums, but slow. Listen to the beat I clap."

He clapped a steady rhythm: Clap. Clap. Clap-clap.

The dolphins copied it. Slower. Steadier.

"Good! Now, seahorses—sing, but match the drum beat."

The seahorses hummed along. At first it was shaky, but then...

Boom-la. Boom-la. Boom-la.

It was working.

## [SCENE 06] — The Music Comes Together

"Now," Max said, "fish—when you hear the drums and the singing together, add your chimes on the beat."

The fish swam in a circle and—

Ting!

Perfect.

Boom-la-TING. Boom-la-TING.

The music came together like pieces of a puzzle clicking into place.

Mia started dancing, spinning in slow underwater twirls. Flop floated along beside her.

Shelly's eyes went wide. "That's it! That's the festival song!"

## [SCENE 07] — The Festival Begins

The music grew louder, richer. Other creatures joined in—a whale adding a deep hum, jellyfish pulsing in time like glowing drums.

The octopus dropped his streamers and started clapping. The crab joined in with his claws. Soon, the whole city was swaying to the rhythm.

Max grinned. "You just had to listen to each other."

One of the dolphins swam over and bumped Max gently with her nose. "Thank you, Hatch Hopper."

Shelly pulled out a small shell, carved with swirling patterns. It glowed the same blue as the hatch.

"A gift," she said, placing it in Mia's hands. "Blow into it, and you'll always hear the rhythm of the ocean."

Mia held it to her ear. She could hear the thump-thump of waves, even underwater.

"Magic shell!" she whispered.

## [SCENE 08] — The Green Glowing Hatch

Shelly led them to the edge of the city, where a hatch glowed green-blue in the sand, surrounded by softly swaying kelp.

"This one will take you somewhere quiet," Shelly said. "After all this music, you might need a rest."

Max knelt beside the hatch. The patterns on it looked like vines and leaves.

Mia pressed her face to the glass. "Maxy, I see trees!"

Max opened the hatch. Inside, the tunnel glowed soft green, and it smelled like fresh grass and rain.

"Where do you think this one goes?" Max asked.

Mia's eyes sparkled. "Maaaaybe... A SECRET FOREST!"

Max laughed. "Only one way to find out."

Together, holding hands, they stepped into the green glowing tunnel.

Behind them, the music of the Underwater Festival played on.
