## Episode 2: The Candy Cloud Castle

Max and Mia tumbled out of the hatch and landed with a poof!

Not on grass.

Not on sand.

On a cloud.

A cloud that smelled like strawberries.

Mia sat up, hair in blonde pigtails bouncing, and poked the ground. Her finger sank in like a marshmallow.

"Maxy… it’s squishy!"

Max stood carefully. The cloud didn’t even wobble. It was like standing on a giant, soft pillow.

All around them floated cotton-candy clouds—pink, blue, and buttery yellow. Above was a bright sky with tiny sparkles drifting like glitter. And in the distance…

A castle.

A tall, twinkly castle made of something that looked like sugar crystals.

Mia gasped. "CANDY CLOUDS!"

Max laughed. "You called it." He hugged Flop under one arm. "Okay, Hatch Hoppers… let’s be careful. Candy places can be… sticky."

They started walking. Each step made a little puff—like stepping on whipped cream.

As they got closer, they noticed something strange.

The castle wasn’t just sparkling.

It was… dripping.

From the highest tower, a stream of chocolate was flowing down like a waterfall.

Mia’s eyes went huge. "Choco-rain!"

"That’s not normal," Max said. "I think something’s wrong."

A tiny bell rang. Ding-ding-ding!

A small floating creature zipped toward them. It looked like a mix between a puffball and a little bird—round and fluffy with candy-striped wings.

"Hiii!" it chirped. "You’re new! You’re new! I’m Sprinkle!"

Mia waved enthusiastically. "Hi Sprinkle!"

Sprinkle hovered in a worried circle. "The castle is melting! The Chocolate Rain Machine is stuck ON!"

"Chocolate Rain Machine?" Max asked.

Sprinkle nodded. "It makes our chocolate rain for dessert time. But it’s raining ALL the time now. The cloud roads are getting gooey. The gumdrop bridges are slipping."

A lollipop-shaped guard in shiny candy armor slid past them on his back.

"Wheeee—WHOOPS!" he called.

Mia giggled.

Max didn’t. "Okay. We can help. Where is the Chocolate Rain Machine?"

Sprinkle pointed a wing toward the castle door.

The castle door was made of two giant peppermint sticks. They creaked open with a minty squeak.

Inside was a hallway that smelled like vanilla. The floor looked like hard sugar glass—pretty, but slippery.

"Hold my hand, Mia," Max said.

"Hands together!" Mia declared, squeezing his fingers.

They tip-toed forward.

At the end of the hall they found a room with a huge machine made of copper pipes, candy buttons, and one big lever labeled: Dessert Rain.

The lever was jammed all the way up.

Chocolate was bubbling through the pipes like fizzy soda.

And sitting beside the machine—sniffling quietly—was a small princess wearing a crown shaped like a gumdrop.

"Are you okay?" Max asked gently.

The princess wiped her eyes. "I’m Princess Poppy. I wanted extra chocolate rain for everyone. Just… a tiny bit more. But then the lever got stuck, and now the whole kingdom is turning into a puddle!"

Mia walked over and held up Flop like a tiny bow. "No cry. We fix."

Princess Poppy smiled a little.

Max examined the machine like a detective. "If we pull the lever down fast, it might splash everywhere. We need to slow it first."

Mia pointed at a row of buttons shaped like candies.

Max read the labels: Slow Drip. Medium Drip. Mega Drip.

The Mega Drip button was stuck down.

Max groaned. "That explains a lot."

Mia reached into her pocket and pulled out a shiny star sticker.

"From my shirt," she said proudly.

Mia pressed the sticker gently under the stuck button like a tiny wedge.

"Try now!" she said.

Max carefully lifted the Mega Drip button. Pop! It sprang up.

The machine immediately stopped rumbling so hard.

"Nice!" Max said. "Okay. Now we pull the lever down… slowly."

He counted like a rocket launch. "Three… two… one…"

He pulled the lever down.

The pipes sighed.

Outside, the chocolate rain slowed from a roaring waterfall to a gentle drizzle… then to a few happy drops.

Princess Poppy clapped. Sprinkle did a loop-de-loop.

"The roads are safe again!" Sprinkle cheered.

Princess Poppy held up one finger. "A little extra is fun. Too much extra is… puddles."

Mia nodded seriously. "Puddles bad."

Max smiled. "Balance."

Princess Poppy led them to a balcony where the sky was painted cotton-candy pink.

"Before you go," she said, "every Hatch Hopper needs a treat." She gave Max a tiny jar filled with sparkling sugar dust. "Sprinkle Dust."

Mia received a heart-shaped marshmallow necklace. "Marshmallow medal!" Mia declared.

Then Sprinkle fluttered toward a fluffy archway behind the castle. "The next hatch is hiding in the Marshmallow Gate!"

Behind the archway was a round metal hatch with swirly patterns—this time glowing mint-green.

Max knelt beside it. "Ready?"

Mia grabbed his hand. "Hands together. Deep breath. Hatch time."

Max laughed. "Exactly."

They opened the hatch.

Inside, the tunnel glowed mint-green and sounded like soft wind chimes.

"Where do you think this one goes?" Max asked.

Mia tilted her head. "Maaaaybe… ROBOT PLAYGROUND!"

Max grinned. "Only one way to find out."

And together, the Hatch Hoppers stepped into the minty light.
