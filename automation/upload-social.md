# 📱 Upload to TikTok & Instagram

Social media is perfect for short clips, teasers, and building audience for your full stories.

---

## Strategy: Full Story vs. Clips

### Full Story (3-5 minutes)
- Upload complete story to TikTok (10 min max)
- Upload to Instagram Reels (90 sec max) in parts
- Best for: Building loyal audience

### Short Clips (15-60 seconds)
- Teaser: First scene + "Watch full story..."
- Highlight: Best moment from story
- Behind-the-scenes: Character art, making-of
- Best for: Discovery & virality

**Recommendation:** Do BOTH! Post clips throughout the week + full story on weekends.
