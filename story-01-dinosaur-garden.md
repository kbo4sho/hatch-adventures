## The Hatch Adventures
### Episode 1: The Dinosaur Garden

Max and Mia were playing in their backyard when Mia's stuffed bunny, Flop, rolled under the old oak tree.

"Maxy, help!" Mia called, pointing at Flop stuck near the tree roots.

Max crawled over and reached for Flop. That's when he saw it—a round metal door built right into the ground, covered in swirling patterns that glowed soft blue.

"Whoa," Max whispered. "Mia, look at this!"

Mia toddled over. "Ooh, pretty door!"

The hatch had a handle shaped like a star. Max looked at Mia. Mia looked at Max. They both grinned.

"Should we?" Max asked.

"Yes yes YES!" Mia bounced up and down.

Max turned the star handle. *Click.* The hatch swung open, revealing a tunnel filled with warm golden light. Without thinking twice, they climbed inside.

**Whoooooosh!**

The tunnel twisted and turned like a slide. Max held Mia's hand tight as they whooshed down, down, down—then *pop!*—they tumbled out of another hatch onto soft, squishy moss.

"Wow," Max breathed.

They were in the biggest, greenest garden Max had ever seen. Trees as tall as buildings reached up to a bright orange sky. Giant ferns swayed in the breeze. Flowers as big as beach balls bloomed in every color imaginable.

And then they heard it.

*Thump. Thump. THUMP.*

"Maxy, look! Big doggy!" Mia pointed.

But it wasn't a dog.

A dinosaur—a real, actual dinosaur!—peeked its long neck through the ferns. It had kind brown eyes and a friendly smile (yes, dinosaurs can smile).

"That's a Brachiosaurus!" Max said, remembering his dinosaur book. "They only eat plants. She's nice!"

"Hi, dino!" Mia waved. The Brachiosaurus bent down and made a soft humming sound, like a giant cat purring.

More dinosaurs appeared—a Triceratops munching on flowers, a Stegosaurus swishing its spiky tail, and three baby dinosaurs playing tag.

"They're having a picnic!" Max said, noticing piles of berries, leaves, and giant fruits arranged on flat rocks.

The Brachiosaurus gently nudged a pile of purple berries toward Max and Mia. She hummed again, inviting them to eat.

"Thank you!" Max said, taking a berry. It tasted like grape and sunshine.

Mia giggled as a baby dinosaur licked her hand. "Tickles!"

For what felt like hours (but might have been just minutes—time was funny in hatch places), Max and Mia played with the dinosaurs. They learned that Triceratops loved belly rubs, Stegosaurus hummed songs, and the baby dinosaurs loved playing hide-and-seek.

When the orange sky started to turn purple, the Brachiosaurus walked them to the edge of the garden. There, hidden behind a waterfall, was another glowing hatch.

"That's how we get home!" Max said.

Mia hugged the baby dinosaurs goodbye. "Bye-bye, dinos!"

The Brachiosaurus bent down one last time. Max patted her giant nose. "Thanks for sharing your picnic with us."

She hummed happily, then gently pushed a smooth, warm stone into Max's hand. It glowed just like the hatch patterns.

"A gift!" Max put it in his pocket.

He took Mia's hand, picked up Flop, and together they opened the waterfall hatch.

Inside, the tunnel glowed a different color this time—soft pink with sparkles.

"Where do you think this one goes?" Max asked.

Mia's eyes went wide. "Maaaaybe... CANDY CLOUDS!"

They looked at each other and laughed.

"Only one way to find out," Max said.

And together, holding hands, they stepped into the glowing pink tunnel.
