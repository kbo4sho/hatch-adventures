   - Act 1: Exit the hatch (10%)
   - Act 2: Discovery (30%)
   - Act 3: Adventure (40%)
   - Act 4: Enter next hatch (20%)
4. **Save as** `story-[##]-[title].md`

### Creating Assets

For each story, create:
- Cover illustration

## 📖 Story Formula (What Makes Them Work)

### The Characters

- **Age-Appropriate:** Simple language, short sentences, positive themes

### The Lessons

## 🎨 Visual Style Notes

### Character Design
